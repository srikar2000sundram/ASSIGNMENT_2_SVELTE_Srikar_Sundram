# API Reference — TheMealDB

Everything the app actually calls lives in
`recipe-finder-app/src/lib/api/mealdb.ts`, and this doc is basically the
notes I kept while wiring it up — I checked every endpoint below against
https://www.themealdb.com/api.php myself rather than assuming, and a
couple of the quirks further down aren't in TheMealDB's own docs at all,
just things I ran into. Why TheMealDB specifically, see
[assumptions.md](./assumptions.md#recipe-data).

**Base URL:** `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/`
The trailing `1` is the shared free test key baked right into the path —
no signup, no auth header, nothing to put in a `.env` file. It's just a
`const BASE_URL` at the top of `mealdb.ts`; if this ever needs to move to
a real paid key, that's a one-line edit in that file, not a config system
I built out in advance for a need that doesn't exist yet.

## Endpoints used

| Purpose | Endpoint | Used from |
|---|---|---|
| Search by name | `search.php?s=<query>` | `/` search bar (`recipe-ui-search-bar` → `searchChange`) |
| Filter by category | `filter.php?c=<category>` | the always-on vegetarian/vegan restriction, not a user-facing chip |
| Filter by area (cuisine) | `filter.php?a=<area>` | `/` filter chips (cuisine row) |
| Filter by main ingredient | `filter.php?i=<ingredient>` | `/` filter chips (main-ingredient row, curated shortlist) |
| List all categories | `list.php?c=list` | client exposes `listCategories`, not currently used by any route |
| List all areas | `list.php?a=list` | client exposes `listAreas`, not currently used by any route (see note below) |
| Full detail lookup | `lookup.php?i=<id>` | `/recipes/[id]` |
| Random meal | `random.php` | client exposes `randomRecipe`, not currently used by any route |

`randomRecipe` and `listAreas` are exports nothing calls from a route
anymore — both were easy to add alongside the others while the response
shape was fresh, and both are tested regardless, so neither can rot
silently.

Neither filter row populates its chip options from TheMealDB's own list
endpoint. The ingredient row never did — `list.php?i=list` returns roughly
600 ingredients, unusable as a chip row. The cuisine row used to call
`list.php?a=list` directly, but crossing that ~195-area list against the
always-on vegetarian/vegan restriction leaves only 24 with an actual
recipe — so it was switched to a curated constant too, checked the same way
the ingredient list is. Both options lists are curated constants now — see
[assumptions.md](./assumptions.md#recipe-data).

Didn't bother with: `search.php?f=<letter>` (redundant with name search for
what this app needs), `randomselection.php` / `latest.php` (premium-only),
multi-ingredient `filter.php?i=a,b,c` (premium-only, V2 endpoint).

## Response normalization

`filter.php`/`search.php` and `lookup.php` don't hand back the same shape,
which tripped me up the first time I wired the discovery grid to a detail
page and wondered why "ingredients" was just missing:

- `filter.php?...` → `{ meals: [{ strMeal, strMealThumb, idMeal }] }` —
  **summary only**, no ingredients or instructions at all. Fine for a grid,
  useless for a detail page.
- `search.php?s=...` and `lookup.php?i=...` → full detail, but ingredients
  come back as 20 separate, mostly-empty fields
  (`strIngredient1`…`strIngredient20` paired with `strMeasure1`…`strMeasure20`)
  instead of an array.

The client normalizes both shapes into this app's own `Recipe` type (see
[data-model.md](./data-model.md#recipe)) right at the boundary — nothing
outside `src/lib/api/` ever has to touch a raw `strIngredient7`-style
field. The ingredient-folding logic is just: walk `strIngredient1..20`,
skip any that are empty/null, and zip whatever's left with the matching
`strMeasure<n>`.

Two things I only found by actually calling the API, not by reading docs:

- **Zero results comes back as `{ meals: null }`, not `{ meals: [] }`.**
  I checked for falsy/empty-array first and got a "recipe not found"
  crash on a legitimate no-results search before I caught this — the
  client has to check for `null` explicitly.
- **An empty `search.php?s=` isn't a zero-result search.** I tried it on a
  whim while looking for a way to power the discovery page's default
  "browse everything" view, and it actually comes back with a real set of
  roughly 25 meals across categories, which is what "Browse" originally
  showed by default before anything else applied. That's since changed:
  the default view is now `filter.php?c=Vegetarian` unioned with
  `filter.php?c=Vegan`, since browse has to obey the same vegetarian-only
  restriction as everything else, and this empty-search trick has no way
  to express that.

## How many requests one query makes

Discovery composes several axes — search and filters intersect rather than
one overriding the other — and each *selection* is its own request, since
the free tier has no multi-value filter endpoint. So a query with a search
term plus the vegetarian/vegan restriction plus one cuisine is
1 + 2 + 1 = **four** parallel requests, intersected client-side.

That is fine at this scale — every axis fires in parallel via
`Promise.all`, and the result sets are a few hundred records at most — but
it is worth knowing before adding a fourth or fifth filter axis. Two things
keep it honest: axes with no selection are never fetched at all, and the
default browse call is skipped entirely once anything else is active.

Every query also carries a **sequence token**. Responses can arrive out of
order (a slow first request landing after a fast second one), so a run that
is no longer current discards its own results rather than overwriting newer
ones.

## Rate limits / reliability caveats

- There's no published hard rate limit on the shared test key, but it's
  the same key every TheMealDB tutorial and demo on the internet uses, so
  I built in the assumption that it can be slow or flaky sometimes. The
  client wraps every call in a try/catch; if something fails, the route
  shows an actual error message instead of crashing — there's no retry
  button, just try searching or filtering again.
- No CORS problems — TheMealDB sets permissive headers, so every call goes
  straight from the browser, no proxy route needed on my side.
- Images (`strMealThumb`) are hotlinked straight from TheMealDB's CDN. I'm
  not downloading or re-hosting them anywhere.
